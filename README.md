# Personal Portfolio (Developing a react app)

## Project Brief

**MVP - Minimum Viable Product**

- **Build a work react app using 3rd part API and Airtable**
- **Use React framework to build an application with at least**
- 5 components
- 4 props
- 2 useStates
- 1 lifting state, which is used to implement CRUD on the client side
- **Deployed on Vercel** (https://eventcatalogue.vercel.app/)

<br>

## Description

Utilising the public API from Ticketmaster, built a minimalistic website which allow the user to browse through upcoming events, add and remove specific events from a list of their favourites

<br>

## Technology Used

````
- React
- Vercel
- Airtable
```

## Wireframes

````

For my wireframe, I created a quick diagram to show the skeleton of the project:

## Planning and Development Process

We had 1 week from ideation to creation and development of the web application:

- [x] Created multiple pages and components which renders the UI
- [x] Succesffuly pulled data from 3rd party API
- [x] Successfully pass data via props to multiple components
- [x] Succesfully setup airtable and airtable API to act as a local database
- [x] Successfully POST and DELETE from the airtable

<br>

## Lessons Learnt

The flow of data across multiple pages and components led to many renaming of variables and repeating functions.

- To regroup once in awhile to minimise repition of code in multiple parts of the project.
- To split up more components corresponding to repeated functions to allow smooth transition when future edits are required within the project across the app

## APIs Used

- [Airtable API] (https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction)
